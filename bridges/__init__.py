Bridge Classes for Count-based Flow Matching

This module contains bridge implementations for different count flow scenarios:
- PoissonBDBridge: Standard Poisson birth-death bridge
- ReflectedPoissonBDBridge: Reflected birth-death bridge (non-negative counts)
- PoissonMeanConstrainedBDBridge: Mean-constrained birth-death bridge
